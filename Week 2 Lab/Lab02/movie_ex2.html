				Andrei Tarkovsky's film "Stalker," released in 1979, is a movie from the Soviet Union that is loosely based on the science fiction novel "Roadside Picnic" by Arkady and Boris Strugatsky. It revolves around a mysterious guide, known as the Stalker, who leads two clients, a Writer and a Professor, through a forbidden and dangerous area called "the Zone". The Zone is said to have the power to fulfill a person's innermost desires. However, the film suggests that the fulfillment of these desires might not bring happiness. The journey therefore becomes one of self-discovery and about the consequences of pursuing one's desires.

The movie is set in a dystopian future, and its narrative blends elements of film noir, science fiction, and political allegory. The film's primary setting is the city of Alphaville, a technocratic and emotionless metropolis governed by a powerful computer named Alpha 60. The movie critiques the dehumanizing effects of technocracy, and features a computer system that controls every aspect of society, eliminating individuality and emotional expression.
